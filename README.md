Implementation of multi-agent abduction based on doxastic temporal logic models, written as part of my [master's thesis](https://findit.dtu.dk/en/catalog/6231d399dd1fd8b3b581abcc). Chapter 3 concerns the implementation including design, algorithms, and benchmarks. Instructions on compilation and usage can be found in section 3.1.3.
